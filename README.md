Attempts to follow and recreate what Andrej Karpathy has done in his tutorial Building Makemore series (Neural Networks: Zero to Hero). 
The first five tutorials are warm-ups/reviews of deep learning concepts. The last one recreated a small and manageable LLM using minimal PyTorch, called Tiny_GPT_dev_*8.9M bits).ipynb.
For completion reasons, a Pythorchified version of the tiny GPT, almost the same one from Andrej's repo, was also included in this repo.
