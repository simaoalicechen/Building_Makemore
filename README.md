Attempts to follow and recreate what Andrej Karpathy has done in his tutorial Building Makemore series (Neural Networks: Zero to Hero). https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ
The first five tutorials are warm-ups/reviews of deep learning concepts. The last one re-creates a small and manageable LLM using minimal PyTorch, called Tiny_GPT_dev_(8.9M bits).ipynb.
For completion reasons, this repo also includes a PyTorchified version of the tiny GPT, almost the same one from Andrej's repo.
